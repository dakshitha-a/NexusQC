# Active Tracker: none

No plan is currently in motion. **Exactly one tracker is active at a time**, and
this file is it; when work starts, this file becomes that plan's tracker.

## How tracking works here

Development is linear, so there is never a reason to have two trackers open at
once. Each plan, feature or non-trivial request gets its own tracker, this file
is whichever one is currently in motion, and when its plan is finished the file
is closed out and moved to [`trackers/`](trackers/), then a fresh one starts
here for whatever comes next.

Closed trackers are kept, never deleted. They are the audit trail for why the
code looks the way it does, and code comments cite them by path:

- [`trackers/2026-08-job-system-overhaul.md`](trackers/2026-08-job-system-overhaul.md)
  the 10-phase job-type/toolchain/agent overhaul. Closed 2026-08-22, 72 steps
  across 5 merged phases.
- [`trackers/2026-08-plots-as-objects.md`](trackers/2026-08-plots-as-objects.md)
  plots as first-class objects: a real chart spec, saved plot records with
  versions, conversational editing, and the Plots panel. Closed 2026-08-22,
  20 steps across 4 merged phases.
- [`trackers/2026-08-excited-state-scans.md`](trackers/2026-08-excited-state-scans.md)
  excited states at every point of a scan or interpolated path, for any method
  and any scan mode, plus the two latent bugs that surfaced underneath it.
  Closed 2026-08-23, 9 steps across 2 merged phases.
- [`trackers/2026-08-scheduler-fairness.md`](trackers/2026-08-scheduler-fairness.md)
  the concurrency cap that bounded admissions per dispatcher tick rather than
  in total, and the rotation pointer that advanced on refused attempts and so
  handed every freed slot back to whoever sat first. Closed 2026-08-23, 5 steps
  across 2 merged phases.
- [`trackers/2026-08-test-job-cleanup.md`](trackers/2026-08-test-job-cleanup.md)
  the suite removing the jobs it creates instead of leaving them in everyone's
  job list. Closed 2026-08-23, 4 steps in 1 merged phase.
- [`trackers/2026-08-frontend-visual-fixes.md`](trackers/2026-08-frontend-visual-fixes.md)
  a long job name pushing the row's stop and delete buttons out of view, viewer
  controls floating over the wrong thing, and orbital isosurfaces corrugated by
  their own cube grid. Closed 2026-08-24, 9 steps across 3 merged phases.
- [`trackers/2026-08-wigner-oscillator-strength.md`](trackers/2026-08-wigner-oscillator-strength.md)
  making oscillator strengths a hard requirement for a nuclear-ensemble
  spectrum, so routing picks an engine that can actually supply them, and
  normalizing the live broadening preview to match the finished figure's
  scale. Closed 2026-08-24, 5 steps across 2 merged phases.

Closing one out means: every step `done` with evidence, a `merged:` row on each
phase, `scripts/check_tracker.py` passing, then `git mv` into `trackers/` and a
new file here. Only the active tracker is machine-checked; an archived one
records what was true when it closed and is not re-verified, since the scripts
its evidence names may legitimately have been deleted since.

## Rules (enforced by `scripts/check_tracker.py`)

- Step status is exactly one of `todo` | `in-progress` | `done`.
- A step may be marked `done` **only with an evidence field**: the
  verification script/command path plus a one-line observed result.
- The tracker edit ships **in the same commit** as the step's final code
  change, so `git log --follow docs/TRACKER.md` is the audit trail.
- A phase's `merged` row records the commit hash the stage landed as, and it
  must be a bare hash; the checker rejects anything else.

Format for a step row:

```
- [status] P<phase>.<step>: <short name>
  evidence: <script/command> → "<observed result>"   (required when done)
```
