# Backlog

The living record of unimplemented bugs and features. Kept short deliberately.
This is a list to work from, not an investigation report. When an item needs
more explanation than a line or two, that reasoning belongs in the commit that
closes it, not here.

## History

This replaces `docs/ROADMAP.md` and the four `docs/e2e-*-2026-08-16*.md` /
`docs/e2e-*-2026-08-17.md` documents, retired once the last two items they
tracked (FR-2's higher-resolution viewer capture, and the Ketcher chunk-weight
reduction) were implemented and verified live. Their full investigation,
findings, the ranked fix plan, and what was checked live versus by inspection
only, is preserved in git history rather than carried forward. To recover one:

```
git log --all --full-history -- docs/ROADMAP.md   # find the last commit that has it
git show <that-commit-sha>:docs/ROADMAP.md          # print its content
```

A fresh testing pass is expected to populate this file going forward, superseding
the 2026-08-16/17 pass's results.

The 10-phase registry v2/agent-rebuild overhaul (`docs/trackers/2026-08-job-system-overhaul.md`, all 72
steps done as of 2026-08-20) retired the `submit_job` tool this file's own
"Open" section used to name. Replaced by `start_job_draft`/
`update_job_draft`/`submit_draft`, whose ready-draft response now always
carries an explicit "NEXT STEP: ... call submit_draft now" instruction,
resolving the skipped-submission problem that item described. Recovered the
same way as `docs/ROADMAP.md` above if the original wording is ever wanted.

## Open

Nothing. The `n_states` defect logged here on 2026-08-25 was fixed the same
day as part of the tracker's Phase 2B, which also audited the other fifteen
required parameters and found fourteen of them equally unguarded -- so it was
closed by a change wider than the entry that prompted it.

Everything else that was here on 2026-08-25 was folded into
[`TRACKER.md`](TRACKER.md) as a phase, and that tracker is the plan being
worked from. Nineteen items in total: seven found by the manuscript evaluation battery,
six carried forward without an owner, and six unexercised deployment
surfaces that were listed as caveats rather than as work.

The list is not lost -- the tracker carries each one with its evidence, and
when it closes out it moves to [`trackers/`](trackers/) like every other
closed tracker. What belongs here again is whatever is found *next*: this
file is for things nobody is working on yet, and adding to the active
tracker instead is how a plan quietly grows to cover everything.

## Unverified deployment surface

Also moved into [`TRACKER.md`](TRACKER.md), as Phase 4. They are not defects
and the tracker says so plainly -- but an unexercised surface with no owner
reads the same as a working one, and leaving them here was what kept them
unexercised.

Found and fixed in the same pass (not backlog items, noted here only so the
next pass doesn't re-discover them):

- **`cas_reco/autocas` refused the whole recommendation whenever the AVAS
  pilot space couldn't host the requested `n_states`.**
  `tests/e2e/e2e_08_job_matrix.py`'s M26 (default request: 3 states, default
  `O 2p` AVAS labels on water/STO-3G) failed live with "The AVAS pilot space
  for this molecule (6e,3o) can host at most 1 many-electron configuration(s),
  fewer than the 3 states requested." Confirmed against the real AVAS method
  (Sayfutyarova, Sun, Chan & Knizia, *JCTC* 2017) and against PySCF's own
  `avas.avas()` call site (`app/chemistry/jobs/pyscf_runner.py`): AVAS is a
  one-electron orbital-selection method with no notion of electronic states
  at all, so gating the recommendation on `n_states` was never something the
  underlying algorithm asked for. It was this app's own guard (`F-020`,
  added after a real crash) doing double duty as both a genuine crash
  preventer and an upfront refusal. Split the two: the early pilot-space
  check is now informational only (the pipeline always runs and always
  produces a recommendation and its entropy plot), and the late guard,
  reached only after the existing entropy-ranked widening already tried to
  make room. Now clamps `n_states` down to what the recommended space can
  actually host and runs the final CASSCF with that many states, instead of
  refusing outright. `summary` carries `n_states_requested` and
  `n_states_clamped_note` alongside `n_states` so the clamp is visible to the
  caller, not just the log. Verified live: the exact M26 case now succeeds,
  clamped to 1 state, `converged: True`; an unclamped request still returns
  `n_states_clamped_note: None`. M26's fixture is left as-is. It now
  regression-tests the clamp path rather than testing a dead end.

- BAGEL had no runner wired up at all for a plain HF `single_point/gs`
  energy job, despite `capabilities.py` declaring it supported. Nothing had
  run that exact combination through the full agent pipeline before this
  pass did. Fixed in commit `03ddb12`.
- `tests/e2e/e2e_00_preflight.py`'s G2a/G2b hardcoded a stale `N_CORES`
  expectation of `8`; both `docker-compose.yml` and `app/config.py`'s real
  default were already `4` and agreed with each other, unreconciled since
  Phase 3/4's fair-scheduler work. Fixed as a one-line test correction; the
  whole preflight script is 16/16 again.
